# Laboratory 2.7: Linear Discriminant Analysis

## Description

In this laboratory practice, you will implement and evaluate a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model. You will work on the following tasks:

0. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository and install the required packages.
   - Verify you can access the iris dataset.

1. **LinearDiscriminant Class Implementation**:
   - Implement the `LinearDiscriminant` class with the following methods:
     - `__init__`: Initialize the LDA model with configurable number of components.
     - `fit`: Fit the model using training data, calculating class means, scatter matrices, and extracting linear discriminants.
     - `transform`: Project data onto the top linear discriminants.
     - `fit_transform`: Convenience method to fit and transform in one step.
     - `predict`: Predict class labels by determining which class mean each sample is closest to in the transformed space.

2. **Model Analysis Components**:
   - Calculate class mean vectors for each class in the dataset.
   - Compute within-class and between-class scatter matrices.
   - Solve the eigenvalue problem for optimal class separation.
   - Extract top linear discriminants based on eigenvalues.
   - Store class means in the transformed space for classification.
   - Calculate class prior probabilities.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Verify model works correctly on binary classification problems.
   - Test model performance on the iris dataset.
   - Evaluate prediction accuracy using appropriate metrics.
   - Analyze how the model separates different classes.

## Uploading Changes to GitHub

To upload your changes to GitHub and have them automatically evaluated using the provided tests, follow these steps:

1. **Stage Your Changes**:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit Your Changes**:
